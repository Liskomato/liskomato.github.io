            <p class="description">
              A foundational Spore ModAPI mod to allow loading Spore creations to and from ZIP files in-game, and to export their raw data.
              <br><br>
              This mod will also allow you to load .package and .zip files from Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit's mLibs folder, allowing you to essentially create .sporemod files containing both creations and the mods required by them.
              <br><br>
              The mod will also allow you to download creations from both Spore.com and elsewhere in the internet straight from the cheat console, without need for a Spore online account. You can download all of the adventure's required assets via this, allowing easier ability to play and share adventures in general.

            <h1 class="main-heading-Roboto-dark">Adventure Checkpoints</h1>
            <p class="description">
              This mod adds a checkpoint system to Spore: Galactic Adventures where if you fail an adventure in any way, you will now be able to restart from the start of act you were on, not just from act 1 (though this option is still available for you if you wanted to restart from the beginning).
              <br><br>
              Also, when you use the checkpoint system to restart from an act, your time and summary will also be restored for the next attempt, meaning you can get a total amount of time taken to complete an adventure when you actually manage to finish it (including with counting the deaths that you took in that time, although failing goals like Protect won't count for that).
              <br><br>
              The mod will also come with three new cheats such as a cheat to jump to any act of your choosing with a time penalty of 30 minutes per act when going forward, a cheat that will allow you to use checkpoints in act 1 or after completing an adventure, and a cheat to check the current settings of the mod.

It does not extend the amount of text bubbles total in each act, goal and creation, but at least now you will no longer be restricted by the 192 character limit imposed on you previously.

              3000 years have passed since the Grox Wars. The galaxy has witnessed an unprecedented era of peace between the empires of the gods and the Free Nations, thanks to the Great Treaty signed 150 years ago. However, when the Grox Emperor's ring is rediscovered, all of that is about to change as the gods of eld make their return to our universe to rekindle their wars once more.
              <br><br>
              It is up to a ragtag group of misfits to take the burden of the Ring of Fate, and transport it to the planet Mortar, located in the center of the galaxy, to unmake this godmaking tool in the only place it can be destroyed: Mount Ruin.<br><br>

              In the neighbouring galaxy of Argentum, an old crisis is rearing its head once more, as the Darkspore hordes of Ea are unleashed into the galaxy once more. When the sage that once cured this sickness changes his side to that of the enemy, it is up to the peoples of both Liskus and Argentum galaxies to stop this horde from attaining its goals for good.

              Uniquely compared to my other adventures and series, this adventure series utilizes the <a href="https://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/DarkInjection/">Dark Injection</a> mod, and thus requires it in order to be playable. <br><br>
